### features

- upload/download files
- rename files/folders
- bulk-download into a zip
- copy/cut/delete operations
- "moving" items via drag and drop
- keyboard shortcuts
- sharing public files

### todo

**necessary:**

- manging share-codes

**wishlist:**

- some sort of preview "sidebar" or modal
  - might requires thumbnail generation
  - but would be nice for in-site viewing of videos, pictures, and documents, without having to
  download to disk
  - would also require streaming video, audio, formatting text files (like markdown), etc
- "tile" view (probably requires thumbnails)
- search
- mobile ("touch") compatibility
- shortcut improvements:
  - using arrowkeys & enter to navigate
  - using "delete" key to delete
- see how many items you are dragging, and if you are copying vs moving (with ctrl key)
